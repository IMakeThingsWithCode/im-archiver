Automatically archives courses from Illustrative Mathematics' accessim.org

This summer, I have to learn Integrated 3 as I'd like to test out of it. So, I'm building this tool that archives the free courses on accessim.org for offline use.

## Try it out:
```bash
# coming soon :D
# goal: one command that curls this repo's bash script and executes it so you don't need to download anything
```

### Todo
- [x] Get first working prototype done
- [x] Adapt to use multiple courses
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] Fix pages to work offline
- [ ] Download formatting -- folder structure and whatnot
- [ ] Polish readme
- [ ] Refactor {variable names, structure} for better readability and adaptability
